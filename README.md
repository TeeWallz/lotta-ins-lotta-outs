### [Live Link](https://ingenious-app.herokuapp.com/)

[Ingenious](https://ingenious-app.herokuapp.com/) is a [Genius.com](https://genius.com/) clone project, featuring code-related song lyrics and programming music knowledge. 

Users can browse a curated selection of songs and their lyrics and view annotated notes and interpretations of the tracks' lyrics. A signed-in user can create, update, and delete their own lyric annotations, as well as leave comments on the tracks and upvote or downvote annotations and comments.
